# A template for NIH style grants in Latex

Each file is included through the master file `FullProposal.tex`. The class file, `grantplate.cls`, provides most of the formatting settings. I use a master `.bib` file and so it is not included here, but the path for it is specified at the top of `FullProposal.tex`. I recommend compiling with `latexmk` or other routine familiar with handling glossaries and references.
